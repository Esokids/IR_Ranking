Remember the scene in the classic '80s action flick Predator where Blain gets eviscerated and the rest of the team blows up seven percent of the Amazon rain forest for payback? If you do, then you will very likely get a kick out of the trailer for The Prophet and The Warlock, a new DLC release for Total War: Warhammer 2 that's set to come out on April 17. 

(If you don't remember, here it is.)

The Prophet and The Warlock adds two new Legendary Lords to the game: The Skink Prophet Tehenauin, 
commander of the Lizardmen's Cult of Sotek, and Warlock-Engineer Ikit Claw of Clan Skryre. Tehenauin's quest 
to annihilate the Skaven is backed by the power of a god, but the Skaven come to the party with Ikit's Doomsphere, 
a Warpstone bomb capable of wiping out entire cities in a single blow. 
Both new Legendary Lords will join the fight for control of the Vortex with unique faction mechanics.
