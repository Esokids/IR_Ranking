Mable and the Wood's titular adventurer has been resurrected by a cult and tasked with murdering her way through a world 
infested by monsters in an attempt to save it. There's just one pretty significant problem: Mable can't even carry her big, 
magical sword. That's where the monsters can unwittingly lend a hand. 

In her regular human form, Mable has to drag her sword behind her, unable to handle the hefty blade, but she's not without 
her tricks. When you kill a boss, you can steal its powers and shape, unlocking new paths in the Metroidvania maze and 
making it easier to kill the monsters barring the way. 

By transforming into Mable's fairy form, for instance, you can deftly leap over enemies, recall the sword and then watch as it cuts 
through them. Becoming a mole, meanwhile, gives Mable claws that can dig through walls, opening up new areas. Medusa, 
a spider and more monsters can be killed and copied.
