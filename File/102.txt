Join GameSpot as we celebrate gaming history and give recognition to the most influential games of the 21st century. 
These aren't the best games, and they aren't necessarily games that you need to rush out and play today, but there's no question 
that they left an indelible impact on game developers, players, and in some cases, society at large.

In 2000, PC gaming was largely a "serious" scene. Counter-Strike, Diablo II, and Deus Ex all launched that year, 
Valve's Half-Life had launched two years prior, and id Software's Quake still had legs four years after its release. 
They were joined by one very odd duck: The Sims. It was the evolution of developer Maxis' previous success in SimCity, but on a more personal scale. 
It was freeform, goofy, and much more "casual" than its contemporaries, and it was clearly something special.
