The Monster Hunter: World crossover event with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has kicked off, meaning you can venture around the New World as Geralt of Rivia.

The event introduces a new permanent contract called Trouble in the Ancient Forest, which you’ll be able to start if you’re Hunter Rank 16 or higher. Just hop into the game and look for a group of Felynes on the deck of the Astera in the trade yard.

Once you talk with them, you’ll be invited to the Research Base, which is where you’ll get your introduction to Geralt, who will agree to look into some strange events going on in the Ancient Forest. At this point, you can start playing as good old Geralt right away, heading straight into the quest. He's equipped with a special version of Monster Hunter: 
World's sword and shield that looks just like the pair of steel and silver swords he uses in The Witcher 3.
