That's not to say that the new McLaren GT, unveiled Wednesday, won't be a lot of fun to drive. It almost certainly will be. But it's longer, quieter, and has lots more luggage space than McLaren's sports cars. There's just a little less emphasis on ultimate cornering ability.
McLaren has previously offered the 570GT, but that was really a sports car with some extra luggage space carved out of its slightly bulbous back. It wasn't engineered, from the outset, to be a touring car so it lacked comfort and refinement. In the new GT, McLaren promises a more relaxing experience.
