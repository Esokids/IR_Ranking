Destiny 2's Season of Opulence, the third and final DLC of the Annual Pass, now has an arrival date: June 4. And there's an unusual twist this time. Typically, when new Destiny 2 DLC drops, the raid only becomes available a few days later, on a Friday. This time the new raid, called Crown of Sorrow, will be available to Annual Pass owners immediately that same Tuesday:

"The world’s first race for a raid is a competitive event," reads Bungie's weekly blog. "The raid is a challenge geared toward testing a fireteam’s ability to learn and execute on the mechanics, as well as their ability to overcome enemies and bosses together. Having a short window of time between release and launch allows us to preserve the combat challenge for players making their attempt on day one and get people playing the raid content right away."
