Making Glaz less lethal while mobile is an interesting rework idea, but I’m skeptical about 
how much of an effect it’ll have. Glaz players will definitely be incentivized to move less through smoke, 
but entry fragging still seems at least party possible. If the yellow highlight returns as quickly as it fades, 
a Glaz could still step into a smoke cloud and spot an enemy through it. One interesting wrinkle to this 
equation will be the new defender Warden, who is rumored to have special hardware that lets him see 
through smoke and flash grenades. At the same time that Glaz’s scope is growing weaker, he’s got a new counter to deal with.
