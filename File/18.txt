 A JFK customs agent tell us what's changed—and what hasn't—over nearly a century of border security.

JANUARY 1925: A battle of wits that extends around the world is ceaselessly fought by the forces of Uncle Sam and the smugglers’ army. 
Thousands of men, keen of brain and ?rm of purpose, are enlisted on both sides, spending vast sums of money, and operating entire navies on 
the seas, and airplanes and motor fleets on land.

Three government services—the Customs, Coast Guard, and Prohibition Bureau—are directly involved in the battle to keep out contraband 
articles and collect the frontier tolls on others. Assisting them are the Department of Justice, with its own worldwide system of secret agents, 
and the post office department, whose inspectors exercise constant vigilance to keep the mails closed to the smuggler. Just how much revenue 
is lost annually by the government through the activities of smugglers, or the total value of forbidden merchandise brought into the country, 
is not known and cannot even be guessed, but the government itself admits the total is quite large.
