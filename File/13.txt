Japan Is Going to Start Hacking Its Citizens

If you have any smart appliance, like a connected thermostat or Wi-Fi security camera, chances are it's extremely hackable. 
Internet of Things devices tend to have such poor security that your best bet, if data privacy is your number one concern, 
is to instead buy the dumbest appliances you can find. But for people in Japan who bought smart devices anyway,
 their government is going to test the security of those devices by trying to hack them.

Starting next month, employees of Japan’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology will travel the country,
 trying to gain access to citizens’ most vulnerable electronics. These employees will use default passwords and lists of commonly
 used passwords to probe some 200 million IoT devices.
