The Hyperloop Is Hurtling Toward the 2020 World's Fair

The centerpiece of the American Pavilion at the next world’s fair, which will be held in Dubai in 2020, 
will be the hyperloop. Earlier this week, Pavilion USA 2020, a public–private partnership between the State 
Department and businesses working on the exhibition, announced the theme of the pavilion—“What Moves You: 
The Spirit of Mobility”—as well as its main feature: an experiential demo of Virgin Hyperloop One’s vehicle.

The pavilion will not only provide a demonstration of how a hyperloop's pods may look and feel, VHO's head of
marketing and communications Ryan Kelly stressed in an interview with Popular Mechanics. It will also preview 
what the overall experience of a new mode of transportation will be like. 

The world's fair will do its part of the simulation by providing the sheer volume of people. “With 25 million people 
estimated to visit over six months, we look at it as an opportunity to show how safety and security will work, 
what boarding ramps will be like—what it’s like at a hyperloop station,” Kelly said.
