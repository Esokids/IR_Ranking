The Tremere, a powerful group of warlocks, are the next vampire clan revealed for Vampire: 
The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2. They’ll join the Brujah in the rain- and blood-streaked streets of 
Seattle when Bloodlines II launches next year.

VentureBeat has the full details on the Tremere clan and its unique powers. Through careful research, 
the Tremere have learned to control vampires’ blood, called Vitae, and use it as a powerful weapon. 
It’s Vitae that gives vampires their superhuman abilities, and the Tremere’s ability to weaponize it makes them powerful and feared, even among vampires.
