It's a multiplayer FPS filled with rocket launchers and bombs, but in an odd twist no one actually dies. 
Rather than blasting an enemy into chunks of flesh and gouts of blood, the rockets and bombs knock simply 
players around, launch them into the air, and blast them out of the arena. It's about as non-violent as you can
imagine a game called Rocket Arena to be. I played it a few rounds at an event in Los Angeles this week, and it's a lot of fun.

Rocket Arena is a 3v3 FPS from Final Strike Games, and a closed beta on PC kicks off on May 23 and lasts until May 29 
(sign up here). The beta will feature six heroes with different weapons and abilities, and there are several different game 
modes, all with quick, frantic, five minute rounds.
