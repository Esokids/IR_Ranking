The same risks exist for all drivers no matter how their vehicle is powered. However, batteries do have special safety precautions, just as one should take precautions whilst pumping petrol (be free of static electricity and avoid using a mobile phone). Some examples of safety precautions include the use of collision detectors, which are able to anticipate damage to the battery, thereby disconnecting the battery’s fuses; cooling systems to avoid overheating; and the Jaguar I-PACE’s 90kWh battery is encased in a protective cell made of aluminium and steel.
