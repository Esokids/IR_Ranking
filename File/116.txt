Ubisoft reported record profitability in its full-year 2018-19 earnings report, 
with net bookings of more than €2.03 billion ($2.27 billion), in line with its target for the 
year of around €2.05 billion ($2.3 billion). The company showed particular strength on the PC, 
with net bookings up nearly 79 percent, accounting for 27 percent of the company's total for the year. 

That figure is up from 18 percent in the previous year, and along with mobile is the only platform 
to increase its slice of the pie: The PS4 dropped from 42 percent to 36, the Xbox One slid from 23 percent 
to 20, the Nintendo Switch dropped a point from 7 to 6 percent, and the remainder—Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, 
and Wii U—held steady at 2 percent. For the final quarter of Ubisoft's fiscal year, the PC actually beat out 
all other platforms, accounting for 36 percent of net bookings, ahead of the PS4 and Xbox One.
