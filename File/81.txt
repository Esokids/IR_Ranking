According to a study by MIT in 2016, 87 per cent of trips by vehicles operating on petrol can be managed by electric vehicles. Most EVs can be conveniently charged at home ports provided by manufacturers upon purchase. Battery charging times have decreased in the years since EVs were first brought to market. Simultaneously, battery life times have been extended. Municipal entities tasked with energy management in Singapore have aggressive plans to increase charging ports across the country to allow EV users added convenience. Strategic driving techniques, manufacturer optimisations and a charging strategy can also alleviate looming fears about range.
