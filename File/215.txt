Though World of Warcraft and other MMOGs utilize the advanced graphics and high-end processing power typical of the current generation of personal computers (PCs), online gaming had its roots in some of the earliest computing technologies. By the late 1970s many universities in the United States were linked by ARPANET (see DARPA), a precursor to the Internet. The structure of ARPANET allowed users to connect their computers or terminals to a central mainframe computer and interact in what was close to real time. In 1980 ARPANET was linked to the University of Essex, Colchester, England, where two undergraduate students had written a text-based fantasy adventure game that they called MUD, or “multiuser dungeon.” When the first outside users connected to MUD through ARPANET, online gaming was born. Soon other programmers expanded on the original MUD design, adding graphic flourishes, chat functions, and player groups (or guilds). These basic features, as well as the fantasy setting, carried over into the next generation of online games, which were the first true MMOGs.
