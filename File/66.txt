As you'd expect from the largest cruise ship in the world, everything about the Symphony of the Seas is on a large scale. There are 18 decks (of which 16 are for guest use), 22 restaurants, 24 pools, 2,759 cabins, a park with over 20,000 tropical plants.
Not to mention the world's tallest water slide at sea.
Like Royal Caribbean's other Oasis-class ships, Symphony is organized in so-called "neighborhoods," and contains seven of them.
