PM Approved: Kickr Smart Bike Trainer
There are cheaper bike trainers out there, but none will feel as much like riding a bike as this.

The experience of using the Kickr is as close to biking outside in the winter as you can get without putting on 
three pairs of socks and all the neoprene you own. It ascends from the world of indoor cycling trainers, 
or fitness equipment, into the various worlds of virtual reality and social media, all while creating that feeling of
wanting to get back outside on the bike, even if it isn’t actually outside.

The future of fitness looks a lot like the Wahoo Kickr paired with Zwift. To say this is the partnership of a stationary 
bicycle with a fitness app would be the undersell of the century. These two technologies can’t be thought of as
just training aids for serious cyclists, or workout gear for those unwilling to exercise in subzero temps. Sure, 
they meet those needs, but the setup moves into the realms of gaming, social media, hanging out with your friends, 
getting lost in a workout, and exploring new places.
