It's So Cold in Chicago That the Rail Company Is Lighting Its Tracks on Fire
When it gets too cold out, some train tracks have to be heated to prevent damage.

Chicago is currently in the middle of a vicious cold spell caused by rogue 
Arctic winds. The temperatures, which reached -30 degrees Fahrenheit, have 
prompted individuals and organizations to take some extreme measures to 
fight the cold. For instance, Metra Rail, which runs some of the commuter 
trains in the city, has taken the extreme measure of setting its tracks on fire.

According to Metra Rail, the important thing to note here is that the tracks 
themselves aren’t actually burning. The flames come from an underground 
series of gas pipes designed specifically to heat the tracks. Workers light the 
fires manually and are always on hand to observe in case something gets out of hand.
