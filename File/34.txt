Tugenhadt's committee is conducting an inquiry into "China and the international rules-based system." In the panel's most recent report, it said members "see considerable grounds for concern about Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G infrastructure."
Bob Seely, another Conservative member of the committee, has argued that "Huawei -- by definition -- cannot be a trusted provider because it comes form a one-party state and is mandated to work with Chinese security services."
