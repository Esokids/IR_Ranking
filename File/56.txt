This means gaps remain in multi-service operations, particularly in operations beyond the First Island Chain or "Far Seas."
China enjoys surveillance superiority over the waters near its coast (the Near Seas) but not in the Far Seas. Its lack of sea-based air power and overseas bases to provide land-based air support limits the PLAN's capacity to project power ashore by other than land-attack cruise missiles or unmanned systems.
