Harmony of the Seas shares much of the same layout and onboard services and activities as Symphony of the Seas (as do the next two ships on the list.)
The billion-dollar ship has a maximum capacity of 6,687 and measures 1,188 feet.
One of its stand out features is the Ultimate Abyss slide, which transports guest down 10 decks at nine miles per hour.
