Netflix, which has been making some forays into gaming, will be at this year's E3 to 
host a panel and drop some game announcements. And it's already off to a fine start, 
nailing the traditional E3 awkwardness by making the announcement via a chat with the 
E3 Twitter account. Brands, will they ever shut up? No.

So we might see some more games inspired by Netflix shows revealed at E3, but I wouldn't be surprised if we heard more about its interactive streaming ambitions, too. Between Bandersnatch, Minecraft: Story Mode and that Bear Grylls thing, Netflix is building a nice little library of interactive shows.

E3 has confirmed the Netflix panel will be at E3 Colosseum.
