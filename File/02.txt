The winner takes it all
Nanowire networks are promising for providing a low-energy solution to storing and processing 
large amounts of data on brain-inspired computer chips.

Memristors are resistors that can simultaneously store and process data. 
Networks of metal nanowires could be used to make memristors for artificial intelligence (AI).

A team that included researchers from University College Cork in Ireland made a random 
network of silver nanowires connected by junctions, similar to the way neurons are connected by 
synapses in the brain. They then tweaked the network until a ‘winner-takes-all’ pathway emerged,
such that all the stored memory became restricted to a single connectivity pathway that required the least energy to create.

Improvements to brain-inspired computing are gradually paving the way for AI with 
increasing levels of seemingly natural intelligence.
