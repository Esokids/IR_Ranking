oogle Calls Hidden Microphone in Its Nest Home Security Devices an 'Error'

Google's Nest Secure home security device is meant to do what its name suggests: make homes safer. 
But, in a completely unsurprising turn, the device is now sparking privacy concerns. The tech giant failed to notify 
users that its home security device came equipped with a microphone, an oversight Google has called an "error," per Business Insider.

The discovery was made sort of by accident. Earlier this month, Google notified users that Nest Guard (the alarm, 
keypad and motion-sensor component of Nest Home Secure) was now compatible with the company's 
Home Assistant voice-control function. However, to be compatible with a voice control feature, the device would 
need to have a microphone, and Google had never made mention of a mic embedded in the device.

The company insists the mic wasn't meant to be a secret. "The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret 
and should have been listed in the tech specs," a spokesperson told Business Insider. But its existence lends credence to 
the very real paranoia about the plethora of microphone-equipped devices all around us—that big tech is eavesdropping 
on us to fuel advertising schemes. And the fact that Google seemingly forgot to tell everyone about it doesn't help.
