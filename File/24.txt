The Drones Are Drilling Holes Now

Built by UNL's NIMBUS Lab, the quadcopter is equipped with a big ol' drill that, once the drone has gingerly landed, 
can be used to burrow into the dirt, sand, or clay beneath it, primarily for scientific purposes. 

But a digging drone isn't as easy as just strapping a drill to a quad. Drones already tend to have short battery lives, 
with top-shelf drones like the DJI Mavic Pro Platinum topping out at 30 minutes. Adding a giant drill that is both heavy in 
flight and requires energy of its own while in use only exacerbates the problem. 

"Battery powered drones have very short flight times, especially when flying with a heavy load, which we are since we 
have our digging apparatus and sensor system," says NIMBUS codirector Carrick Detweiler, speaking to IEEE Spectrum. 
The NIMBUS solution? More drones.

"We need to hitch a ride on another vehicle," Detweiler says. After flying with another drone, it parachutes in. 
"This allows allows it to save energy for return trips. In this video we used a much larger gas powered UAS with multiple 
hours of flight time, but our same system could be deployed from manned aircraft or other systems."
