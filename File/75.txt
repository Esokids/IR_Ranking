The Santa Monica, California-based startup that pioneered electric scooter-sharing is launching a monthly rental program in San Francisco despite not having formal government approval.
For $24.99, a person can have an e-scooter delivered to them, and ride it for a month. For regular riders, it's a more affordable option than renting one of the city's shared e-scooters or taking most others modes of transportation. Bird is the first scooter company to launch such a program.
But Skip, one of Bird's competitors that was granted a permit to operate shared e-scooters in San Francisco, is crying foul. The city hasn't determined if the new program is legal.
