“Dungeon Fighter Online has proven itself to be a timeless classic and the love and support shown by the game’s developers only proves that this game should have never disappeared in the first place. With its heavily skill-based combat, excellent PvP structure and old school vibe, DFO is a game that every fan of beat ‘em ups and fighting games alike should try out. Despite some of its issues, the pros definitely outweigh the cons on this. I don’t tend to speak highly of F2P games these days, but this one in particular gains my highest recommendation.”

“From first-time gamers to experts of both the fighting and MMO game styles, Dungeon Fighter Online has aspects and techniques ready to ensure a good experience for a massive range of people. With such selections available, it is easy to see why so many people continue to play Dungeon Fighter, and even easier to see why people would come back time and again to play new characters and try out even more aspects of the game.”

“The connection Neople has made with its English-speaking community is unprecedented, and it may be one of the reasons the game makes it to launch and (hopefully) succeeds. This is how communicating with consumers should be: Completely organic.”
