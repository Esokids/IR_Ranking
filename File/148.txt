You can no longer play duos in Battlefield 5's battle royale mode, Firestorm. 

DICE removed duos this week because not enough people were playing it—but said that it will return in the future, 
albeit it as a temporary mode.

Duos was never meant to be a mainstay of Firestorm: it was added last month as a time-limited mode for a weekend only. 
But when that weekend was over, players asked for more, and DICE was happy to bring it back, seemingly as a more 
permanent feature. Now, however, DICE says that players are more 
interested in squad play than duos, and so it's returning to its original plan.
