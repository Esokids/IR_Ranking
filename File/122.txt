Denuvo is an unpopular DRM solution that's nevertheless still used by a large number of PC game publishers, including Ubisoft, Sega, Square Enix, and others. Last year, Denuvo argued that cracking and pirating games is inevitable, and its main goal "is to protect initial sales" before cracks are released. But with Bethesda's Rage 2 defanged of its DRM in less than 24 hours, that promise isn't holding up well in 2019. 

In this case, a weakness in Denuvo's security wasn't actually to blame. According to posts on the CrackWatch subreddit, while the Steam version of Rage 2 shipped with Denuvo, the .exe on the Bethesda Launcher did not contain the DRM. That strange oversight (or choice) on Bethesda's part gave crackers a way in. Access to a clean executable seemingly made it trivial to release a crack that bypassed Rage 2's online check-in at launch.

Crackers didn't even have to wade into Denuvo's code to pirate Rage 2, and it's sadly common for games that don't have strong copy protection to be cracked on release day, according to CrackWatch. But looking at other Denuvo games released this year, the DRM doesn't seem to be holding up as well as it did in the past, even without slip-ups like Bethesda's.
