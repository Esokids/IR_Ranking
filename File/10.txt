Reecho EchoWeek review: The smallest earpods with decent sound profile

Even as wireless earpods become common and affordable, it is only a natural progression that they also become smaller. 
The Reecho EchoWeek is for sure the smallest I have used, or seen.

The Reecho EchoWeek is a wireless earpods that uses the latest Bluetooth 5.0 standard. It comes with a small charging dock 
where you can also store the device when not in use. An issue with a lot of these earpods is the fact that they are not very good with 
the pairing as most need to be paired with each other before they pair to a source device.

The EchoWeek poses no such issues, though you see the left-right units separately on Bluetooth settings they pair as one, and stay paired. 
From that point on the device pairs to the source as soon as you take it out of the box. The design is quite stunning, just for the sheer size 
of these pods. They are small enough to be fully inside your ears, almost like a hearing through a bit larger than that. Walking around 
with these in your ears, some might think that you work with the security services.
