Each week Bungie updates players of its shared-world online shooter with the latest info from the development team. 
Normally it's a fairly sedate affair, peppered with info about forthcoming events, but today's installment was a sandbox 
balance special, and it's fair to say the fans are far from happy with the changes coming.

In preparation for the Season of Opulence, the Destiny 2 sandbox team (which is responsible for weapons and abilities) 
detailed a suite of nerfs to some of the most powerful exotic gear, explaining that forthcoming endgame content has 
proved too difficult to design and balance around these OP items. 

Bungie added that it would normally look to underused gear to compensate, but that would ultimately lead to the kind of 
powercreep that would make designing, say, a new raid, impossible. Whilst the logic sounds reasonable enough, 
the reality is that players are pissed that some of their most most beloved, hard-earned toys are being neutered. 

The biggest changes being made are to Whisper of the Worm, a high impact sniper rifle that will no longer endlessly 
generate ammo provided you hit critical hits. It's getting deeper reserves to compensate for the fact that bullets 
will no longer apparate from thin air. The knock-on effect, though, is that the cool but convoluted quest associated 
with earning this item now seems, well, a lot less alluring.
