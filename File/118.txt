Following the Brujah and Tremere, the latest Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 clan is Toreador, 
all silk shirts, wine and sexy parties. They're the hotties of the undead world, seducing mortals and probably 
going to lots of exclusive clubs.  Watch one of them enjoying a snack in the trailer above. 

Toreador vampires are obsessed with beauty and art, turning musicians and painters to add to their 
collection of creative hedonists. In Seattle, they're one of the most prominent clans and they've been 
around for a while, shaping its character over centuries. But they're in decline as Seattle becomes more corporate. 

Like the Brujah clan, the Toreador are quick, using their Celerity discipline to zip around in a fight 
and move so quickly time seems to slow down to a crawl. But their real trick is ability to stun people 
just by being supernaturally gorgeous.
