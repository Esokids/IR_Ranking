Cities: Skylines is a pretty comprehensive city builder, but it looks like we've been ignoring our citizens' brains and they've been turning to mush thanks to our lack of attention. Not to worry, there's an expansion coming for that, too. The upcoming Campus DLC, due out later this month, will let you design your own university, activate new education policies and nurture eggheads with research grants.

A trio of campuses can be plonked down, including trade schools, liberal arts colleges and universities. These bastions of braininess can then be expanded by increasing the reputation of your academic institutions, unlocking a bunch of new buildings that will help you better chisel the minds of tomorrow. 

You can take care of their physical well being, too, thanks to college sports. Football, basketball, baseball, running and stuff—all the classic sweaty activities. These teams will need looking after, as well, hiring coaches and cheerleaders, selling tickets to the games and designing their uniforms.
