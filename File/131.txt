At last year's Computex, Asus announced Project Precog, a proof of concept, AI-powered notebook supposedly releasing later in 2019. Before that, you may remember that, at CES 2017, Razer made a splash with its Project Valerie triple-screen gaming laptop. Now, following in the footsteps of its competitors, HP is making its own dual-screen gaming laptop, namely the HP Omen X 2S. 

Revealed to the press last week at the HP Gaming Festival in Beijing, alongside refreshed versions of the HP Omen 15 and 17, several gaming mice, a wireless charging mousepad and a 25-inch monitor, the Omen X 2S starts at $2,099.99. As such, HP says, it's meant for "affluent gamers" whose lavish tastes demand "the latest tech to optimize their experience." The second screen in particular sits above the RGB per-key backlit keyboard and is quite small given its 1080p resolution, at 6 inches diagonal. Survey says, it's intended to replace your smartphone while gaming.
