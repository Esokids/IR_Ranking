Crysis is one of the most demanding games ever released, and it can still chug at times even on modern extreme hardware. But that hasn't stopped one modder, Pascal Gilcher, from pushing things to the next level, attempting to inject path tracing calculations into the mix. It's currently not quite as polished as the Minecraft path tracing mod, but the results are nevertheless impressive.

Pascal's ReShade filter (in alpha form—you have to be a Patreon backer to get access) attempts to apply path traced global illumination to games. Yes, any compatible game can in theory add global illumination, not just Crysis. But an older game like Crysis seems like the perfect playground for such shenanigans, and EuroGamer / DigitalFoundry put it to the test—in co-op mode, just to take things to the next level.
