Samsung offers a closer look at its foldable phone in a 4-minute video

Samsung is offering a much closer look at its Galaxy Fold in a new 4-minute video. 
The footage of Samsung’s foldable phone is mostly silent B-roll, but it offers the chance to 
see and hear the folding phone complete with its clicks, bloops, and beeps in various modes. 
There’s a selection of close up shots that show the hinge of the device, the phone and tablet modes, 
and the slight gap when it’s closed.

Samsung also shows a variety of apps, including Instagram, Google Maps, the camera in both 
tablet and phone mode, Netflix, and mobile games. Samsung’s DeX software is even shown, 
allowing the Galaxy Fold to connect to a display via USB-C and change into a more desktop-like experience. 
We also get to see the different color variations of the Galaxy Fold a lot more clearly.
