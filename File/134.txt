Battlefield 5 players in Australia and New Zealand are reporting difficulties getting a match in the game's Firestorm battle royale mode. According to widespread player reports, both on Reddit and the official EA troubleshooting forum, long matchmaking waits and high ping have wracked the mode since its launch in late March.

One of the most popular discussions on the official Battlefield V subreddit claims that the game is "effectively discontinued" in the Oceania region, and the complaints issued by its author mirror a lot of the concerns elsewhere.

"What began as 10+ minute wait times for each match and a minimum of 190 ping has finally reached the point of it being essentially impossible to play the game at any time of day in any mode," user CiaranDoherty wrote. "For all intents and purposes, there is no such thing as Firestorm in this continent and to EA/DICE, your marketing material should reflect this. Please do not advertise Firestorm here, there are no players, no functional servers and no possibility for anyone buying the game for Firestorm to actually get what they paid for."
