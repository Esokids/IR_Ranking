Drones Are Dropping Poison on Rats in the Gal?pagos
Scientists hope that they've built a better rat trap with flying poison distribution.

For as long as people have been creating organized communities, rats have been there to pick off the remains.
 As an invasive species, they're practically unparalleled in their success, much to the chagrin of the people living with them. 
But when they recently re-invaded Ecuador's Gal?pagos National Park, a new weapon proved extremely effective in the fight: drones.

While the Gal?pagos islands are historic for being the site of Charles Darwin's discoveries about evolution, 
other visitors have been less helpful. Rats first came to the Gal?pagos along with pirates or whalers sometime in the 17th or 18th century.
 While the exact timeline is unknown, they've done their damage over the years. They've curbed the births of tortoises and have laid waste to local fauna.
