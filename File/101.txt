E3 2019 is just around the corner. The annual trade show returns on June 11, but before then, a number of the industry's biggest publishers will hold press conferences showcasing some of the new games they have in the pipeline. That includes Bethesda, which confirmed it is hosting its own E3 press conference again this year just a couple of days ahead of the expo proper.

This year, Bethesda's press conference takes place on Sunday, June 9, a few hours after Microsoft's E3 Xbox One briefing. The presentation is set to kick off at 5:30 PM PT / 8:30 PM ET (1:30 AM BST on June 10) and will be broadcast online for viewers at home via Bethesda's Twitch channel and other places.

As for what we can expect from the conference, Bethesda has been very tight-lipped. During last year's briefing, the publisher unveiled a number of huge titles, including Rage 2, Doom Eternal, The Elder Scrolls VI, and a brand-new property, Starfield. So far the publisher has only confirmed that Doom Eternal will have a presence at this year's conference, but it certainly won't be the only game the company shows off. We know DLC for Rage 2 is on the way, so we may get our first glimpse at that during this year's briefing.

However, two titles we can safely rule out are Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI. Last month, Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed that neither title will be at this year's show. According to the company, last year's reveals were just a "sneak peak" at the technology it's been working on, and that both Starfield and ES6 are still a ways off, so we'll likely need to wait a little longer to get more details about those games.
