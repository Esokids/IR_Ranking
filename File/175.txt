Fortnite Season 9 kicks off today, and the patch notes have been revealed. Check out the cinematic reveal trailer above, where the dark fate of banana man Peely is revealed.

The highlights of Season 9, then: New locations like Neo Tilted and Mega Mall have emerged in the wake of the volcano's eruption, bringing the map some more futuristic-looking new locations to check out. Peely's Banana Stand and Nugget Hut are among the places to see. A new transportation system called Slipstreams are also a major part of this update, which let you travel around the map using streams of wind.

Here's how Epic describes Slipstreams:

These tunnels of wind passively carry players down the stream.
Players can move faster and change direction when actively trying to move down the Stream.
Use directional input to gain extra velocity. Experiment with bobbing up and down for higher speeds.

Players are launched when exiting the tube based on their movement speed and exit angle.
