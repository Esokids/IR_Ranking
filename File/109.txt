Deck-building games typically give you cards that represent weapons or spells or a big orc who wants to smash heads. 
Sometimes you get a field. Your deck is your arsenal. Not so in Signs of the Sojourner, however, where you must use 
cards to forge connections with people and develop your personality. 

It's a narrative card game where battles are replaced by conversations where the goal isn't to 'win'. Both you and the 
person you're talking to put down cards in an effort to match symbols that reflect personality traits. If the conversation 
goes well, you can then swap one of your cards for a new one, a trait you've learned, making it easier to connect with other people. 

There are more advanced cards the can duplicate other cards and slot between ones already in play, but you'll need to meet 
new people to get access to them.  There are also ways to stop you get a strike even if you can't match the previous card, 
so you've got quite a few options. It's unusual because the people you chat to are trying to help, and if you play the right thing, 
they can complete the board in one go and let you move onto the next part of your conversation. It's not adversarial, 
though sometimes it might be difficult to find common ground.
