Quantic Dream's previously Playstation-exclusive lineup of games—Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls, 
and Detroit: Become Human—are now available for pre-purchase on the Epic Games Store. All three 
games are currently discounted as part of the Epic Mega Sale, and "sizeable" demos for all three will be
 available before each game is released. 

"Bringing our last three interactive dramas to the PC platform will enable new audiences to experience
 what Quantic Dream games are all about," Quantic Dream co-CEO Guillaume de Fondaumi?re said. 
"Through these demos, gamers will have the opportunity to look into the hard work and dedication we 
have put into the PC versions of our beloved titles. For those who have never played a Quantic Dream title, 
this will be a great opportunity to experience the unique nature of our games."
