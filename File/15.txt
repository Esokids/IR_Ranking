A 150-Year Old Weird Ancient Animal Mystery, Solved

What, exactly, was a stylophoran? That question is a minor mystery that has gnawed at scientists since the tiny fossilized 
creatures were first discovered 150 years ago.

The stylophorans' tiny, confusing bodies resembled a hybrid of primitive vertebrates and starfish. But now, after a century
 and a half of struggle, scientists have finally placed the animal within its appropriate family. Bertrand Lefebvre of with the 
French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the Laboratoire de G?ologie in Lyon, France, discovered that the 
millennia-old mystery animal is, in fact, an echinoderm—from the same family as a starfish.

As you can see in the picture above, stylophorans had appendages that appeared to be tails, reminiscent of modern vertebrate 
animals like salamanders. Instead of spines, though, they had primitive vertebrate composed of calcite plates.
