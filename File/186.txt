If a single weapon contains the essence of a first-person shooter, it's undoubtedly the shotgun. Early in Rage 2, protagonist Walker—a wasteland ranger who can be either male or female, depending on your preference—finds a futuristic combat shotgun hidden away in an Ark: a kind of advanced fallout shelter designed to protect humanity and its precious technology from a cataclysmic asteroid impact. Rage 2 has a lot of problems, including a forgettable open world, a weak story, and terrible vehicle handling, but man, that shotgun. The instant you fire it, you know, everything else aside, it's a quality FPS.

This semi-automatic weapon of mass destruction is loud, violent, and obnoxious: a bit like Rage 2 itself, in fact. When you unload a round of buckshot into a hapless enemy you can almost feel the shockwave rippling through your shoulder. But it's the alternate fire mode, activated by holding the right mouse button, that really makes it special. The spread tightens and the force of the impact increases massively. Enemies are thrown savagely backwards by the blast, into walls, over railings, and off the side of cliffs.

And you're going to need firepower like this to stop The Authority, an army of mechanical mutants marauding across the sun-scorched wastelands of this bleak, asteroid-battered Earth. Defeating these guys and their leader, General Cross, is your primary motivation in Rage 2—not to mention fighting off gangs of raiders, bandits, and other goons. But honestly, the story is entirely forgettable. The combat is the black, beating heart of the game, and the reason you'll keep playing long after you've stopped caring about the plot.
