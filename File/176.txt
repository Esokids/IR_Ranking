Two Point Hospital developer Two Point Studios is now a part of Sega, which announced today that it has acquired the studio after working with it as a publisher for more than two years. Sega said the acquisition is the first to come about as a direct result of Sega Europe's Searchlight program, which seeks out and supports "exciting new development talent" and games.

"We’re delighted to welcome Two Point Studios officially in to the Sega family. As a relatively new, British-based developer with a global hit already under their belts, we knew we had to move quickly on this deal because they are an extremely attractive investment proposition with a great deal of talent," Sega Europe president and chief operating officer Gary Dale said.
