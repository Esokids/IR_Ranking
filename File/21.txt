The Solar Revolution Is Coming—But It's Skipping Over Communities of Color

While the United States has seen substantive growth in homes using photovoltaic (PV) solar energy over the last several years, 
this growth has been uneven. According to a new study from Tufts, fewer African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods are 
gaining the benefits of solar power, even when controlling for home ownership and income level.

“Solar power is crucial to meeting the climate goals presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
but we can and need to deploy solar more broadly so that it benefits all people, regardless of race and ethnicity,
” says Deborah Sunter, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Tufts and the study’s lead author, 
in a press statement. “Solar energy can be a resource for climate protection and social empowerment.”

The study used Google's Project Sunroof, which collects data from Google Maps to analyze the solar potential 
of neighborhoods as well as how many solar projects exist in any given area.
