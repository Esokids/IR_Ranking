Don't Starve: Hamlet has made it through the trials of Early Access and has launched on Steam. The third DLC for 
Klei's endearing survival game swaps the wilderness for a lost town full of aristocratic pigmen, complete with 
homes and shops and all the trappings of civilisation. Unfortunately, that inevitably comes with new dangers, 
not least of which is a huge robot with a penchant for murdering people with lasers.

To survive, apparently, you'll need to befriend the pigmen and start a new life with them. You'll be able to become 
a resident yourself, getting a new home that you can renovate and decorate. No more mucking around in the woods for you! 
OK, some mucking around in the woods.

The porktropolis is surrounded by a tropical jungle that hides plenty of things that want to kill you, but also secrets to 
discover in the ruins of an ancient pigmen civilisation. Archaeology is a pretty respectable profession if you want to 
join the porcine gentry. There are new crafting recipes, too, and you'll probably need to venture out into the jungle to 
search for the ingredients.
