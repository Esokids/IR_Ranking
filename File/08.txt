Vodafone boss: U.S. needs to share any Huawei evidence with Europe

BARCELONA (Reuters) - The United States needs to share any evidence it has about Huawei with 
European authorities so they can take a common view about whether to use the Chinese group’s technology 
in their networks, the head of Vodafone said on Monday.

Huawei is under intense scrutiny after the United States told allies not to use its technology 
because of fears it could be a vehicle for Chinese spy operations.

The company is the world’s largest mobile network gear supplier, ahead of Sweden’s 
Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia.
