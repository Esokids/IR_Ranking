Elon Musk, Rick and Morty fan and billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who smoked weed once, is an indecently rich man who could use his money to solve a lot of problems today, but instead chooses to make electric cars for other rich people and crash rockets into boats. And how he's the butt of a bad joke in Rage 2 as part of a secret mission.

While wandering the wasteland, I notice some alluring bunker doors embedded in the side of a mountain and as we all know, if there's a bunker there's probably a lonely, mad person inside (or at least the skeleton of one).

This particular lonely, mad person goes by Elton Tusk, as the data pads strewn about the bunker say. He's the former—well, technically, current CEO of Tusk Industries, if you want to continue to believe in capitalist hierarchies in the post-apocalypse. 

Posters reference space travel and eco-pods and nanotrites, data pads detail Tusk's great imagination, innovative technologies, and obscene wealth—all of which are directly contributing to the power struggles in Rage 2's apocalypse scenario. Let's line up the evidence:

Elton Tusk = Elon Musk
CEO of a company researching space travel, nanomachines, useless things
Rich guy deemed a "great science mogul"
It's an Elon Musk bit, no doubt about it.
