Most industry experts and industry research suggest 2025 will be the tipping point of electric vehicle (EV) adoption. But right now, major car brands are outpacing one another by continually launching new models featuring state-of-the-art technologies. Across the board, experts in green energy see widespread acceptance of electric vehicles replacing their petrol-fuelled counterparts. According to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast, electric cars will comprise one-third of cars worldwide by 2040. Electric vehicles already make up one-third of all new car sales in Norway.
