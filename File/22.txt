Industrial Cranes Are Disturbingly Hackable

Ever wanted to control a giant crane? Hackers might be able to help you out. Cybersecurity experts at Trend Micro have shared 
an upcoming paper with Forbes that details the various ways in which commercial cranes are extremely susceptible to hacking attempts. 

The main vulnerability, the paper states, is that many cranes are controlled with devices that use ancient, proprietary wireless protocols. 
These protocols tend to contain vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit since they were designed at a time that safety was a higher 
priority than security. Now, more standardized and secure protocols have been developed, but cranes that haven't been updated to 
use them only have security through obscurity; once hackers know what kind of proprietary protocol a given crane uses, the hacking is fairly trivial. 

Trend Micro's flashy paper lays out the various exploits hackers found to be possible, which range widely in severity. On the more covert and less 
dangerous end, hackers were able to engage cranes' safety override features and essentially render them useless by constantly shutting them down.
On the more flashy and dangerous end, hackers were able to give cranes completely fabricated commands and could even do so remotely so long 
as a small piece of hardware to relay the nefarious instructions was hidden somewhere on the scene.
