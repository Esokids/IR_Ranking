One of the best things about PC gaming is the freedom of choice it offers compared to gaming on consoles. 
Obviously, you can choose the components that go into your PC and the operating system you run it on,
 but you can also select where to purchase digital copies of your games. You can buy direct from the likes of Steam 
or the Epic store if you like, but you can also venture beyond those storefronts and shop around for cheaper deals 
on many other sites.

The downside of this can be that you don’t always know how those keys were acquired by the reseller in question.
 With Voidu, however, you’ll have no such problems. Voidu is an official e-tailer that works directly with official 
developers and distributors in sourcing their keys, guaranteeing that a fair share of your purchase goes back 
the developer who created the game (you can learn more about how the company’s creation and success here). 

It isn’t just the developers who benefit from working with Voidu either. The company also has regular deals 
each month with some impressive discounts. These limited-time offers are arranged directly with each publisher, 
intended to give you the best deals on games possible with legitimately sourced keys. Delivery is also instantaneous, 
and there are no transaction fees. There’s no middle-man here, only Mega Man.

By being a PC Gamer reader, you get a massive discount of 25% off on any game, in any region by entering
