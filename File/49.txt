he idea for the campaign was conceived in November 2017 by Abramovich himself after an informal meeting with the club's board. Abramovich, who is Jewish, raised concerns over a rise of anti-Semitic incidents across the world and suggested Chelsea attempt to address the issue.
Writing in the matchday magazine, Abramovich reaffirmed his commitment to fighting anti-Semitism, especially in the wake of the attack in Pittsburgh and the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California, last month.
