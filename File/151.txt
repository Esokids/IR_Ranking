PayDay 2 and Overkill's The Walking Dead publisher Starbreeze has revealed via its Q1 2019 financials that the company will not last a further 12 months unless additional funds can be found.

Starbreeze had a disappointing 2018, and was forced to restructure following the poor sales of Overkill’s The Walking Dead, and began selling off publishing rights last year, including the rights to System Shock 3 and 10 Crowns. It also laid off 40 of its then 622-strong team.

The Q1 2019 financial report (thanks, MCV) sees Starbreeze acting CEO Mikael Nermark acknowledge that the company is now "in a challenging situation" after it wrapped up the first quarter of the current financial year with a gross loss of 122,773 Swedish Krona ($12.8K / ?9.8K) despite an increase in PayDay 2 sales. With a "liquidity shortfall" expected before mid-year 2019, the company may now be forced to close. 

"Starbreeze and some of its subsidiaries have been in reconstruction since 3 December 2018," the company wrote in its financial summary. "The company currently lacks sufficient secured funds to guarantee continued operations for the next 12 months and is expected to have a liquidity shortfall before mid-year 2019 if no additional funds are provided. These conditions indicate that there are significant uncertainties that can lead to significant doubts about the company’s ability to continue its business."
