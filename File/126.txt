Figment is a bizarre, beautiful action-adventure game that Austin described as looking like something made by 
Dr. Seuss—although he also took issue with the "action-adventure" descriptor, saying in his 2017 preview that it's really 
more of an environmental puzzle game. Whatever you want to call it, it's bizarre, beautiful, well regarded (although not widely noticed), and it's getting "encore" DLC later this year. 

"With the reception we got from players that finished the game, we simply knew we had to take the stage again for an encore,
" Bedtime Digital Games CEO Klaus Pederson said. 

The original game takes place within the labyrinthine confines of the human mind, where things are not as they once were. 
New, dark thoughts are taking shape as terrible creatures that spread fear wherever they go, and the only ones who can stop 
them are Dusty, the voice of courage, and his ever-optimistic pal Piper, who venture into the strange, threatening world to solve puzzles, fight enemies, and set things right.
