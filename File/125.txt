I really like the Trine games, and I had high hopes for Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power when developer Frozenbyte announced that it would go fully 3D. It didn't work out quite as expect, though, to the point that for awhile the future of the studio seemed to be in doubt. 

Frozenbyte managed to pull through and earlier this year announced Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince as a return to the series' original side-scrolling style. Today publisher Modus Games revealed some of the process that led up to that with a "making of" video that looks at the history of the series and shows off some early Trine 4 gameplay.
