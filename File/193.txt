Ubisoft announced today that the upcoming historical strategy game Anno 1800 will be an Epic Games Store exclusive. 
It's scheduled for release on April 16, and so the last-minute change might naturally conjure memories of the Metro 
Exodus storefront switcheroo from earlier this year. But this case is a little bit different. 

As with Metro Exodus, anyone who has pre-purchased the game on Steam will receive it there. 
But unlike Metro, Anno 1800 will remain available for pre-purchase on Steam right up to the scheduled launch date: 
It will only be removed from Steam after that. Ubisoft also emphasized that Steam owners will receive all the same updates 
and new content as those who purchase it from Epic or Uplay, and that all versions will be multiplayer compatible.
